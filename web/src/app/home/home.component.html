  <h1>Science</h1>
  <p>
    Science (from the Latin word scientia, meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise that builds and
    organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.
    <br>
    The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.
    Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy
    of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the
    physical world based on natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek
    conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE)
    of the Middle Ages but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age. The recovery
    and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th
    century revived "natural philosophy", which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that
    began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and
    traditions. The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not
    until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to
    take shape; along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural science."

  <p>
    Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences
    (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences
    (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences
    (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement,
    however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence.
    Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine,
    are described as applied sciences.
    <br>
    Science is based on research, which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well
    as in government agencies and companies. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence
    of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of
    commercial products, armaments, health care, and environmental protection.
  </p>
  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>
    Science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations.
    Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results, so it now defines what
    for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge.
    In particular, it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share.
    For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history
    and led to the development of complex abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex
    calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, public works at national scale,
    such as those which harnessed the floodplain of the Yangtse with reservoirs, dams, and dikes,
    and buildings such as the Pyramids. However, no consistent conscious distinction was made between
    knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge,
    such as mythologies and legal systems. Metallurgy was known in prehistory, and the Vinƒça culture
    was the earliest known producer of bronze-like alloys. It is thought that early experimentation
    with heating and mixing of substances over time developed into alchemy.
  </p>
  <h1>
    Natural science
  </h1>
  <p>
    Natural science is concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena
    based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. It can be divided into two main branches:
    life science (or biological science) and physical science. Physical science is subdivided into branches,
    including physics, chemistry, astronomy and earth science. These two branches may be further divided into
    more specialized disciplines. Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began
    in Ancient Greece. Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which
    were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives,
    conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science. Systematic
    data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century
    by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on. Today, "natural history" suggests
    observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.
  </p>
  <h1>
    Social science
  </h1>
  <p>
    Social science is concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society.
    It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, anthropology, archaeology, communication
    studies, economics, history, human geography, jurisprudence, linguistics, political science, psychology,
    public health, and sociology. Social scientists may adopt various philosophical theories to study individuals
    and society. For example, positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences
    as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social
    scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing
    empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice,
    researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative
    and qualitative research). The term "social research" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners
    from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.
  </p>
  <h1>
    Formal science
  </h1>
  <p>
    Formal science is involved in the study of formal systems. It includes mathematics, systems theory,
    and theoretical computer science. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by
    relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different
    from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for
    empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts. The formal sciences are therefore a
    priori disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.
    Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences. Calculus, for example,
    was initially invented to understand motion in physics.Natural and social sciences that rely heavily
    on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology,
    mathematical finance, and mathematical economics.
